<a name="b"><h3>SIM11  ON-LINE  HELP :   b  command</h3></a>
<pre>

SYNOPSIS
                b [ addr [ , &lt;command_list&gt; ] ]

DESCRIPTION
     Without a parameter this command supplies a list of all active "break-
     points",  i.e. those addresses of instructions which when reached (and
     before they are executed) cause the execution to stop and a  new  user
     command  to be requested.
     
     When an expression is supplied as the first parameter to this command,
     a breakpoint is installed at the address represented by the expression.

     The second  parameter is a list of  simulator commands  to be executed
     when reaching the breakpoint. If you do not want to stop at the break-
     point, the last command on that list should be "c", or "p", or "t".
     Note that, the whole list must be enclosed in angle brackets:
     &lt; ... ; ... &gt; .

<a href="#top">Back to top</a>
<a name="d"><h3>SIM11  ON-LINE  HELP :   d  command</h3></a>
<pre>

SYNOPSIS
                d  [ addr ]

DESCRIPTION
     Without a parameter this command nullifies (deletes) all active break-
     points.   When  an  expression  is present, only the breakpoint at the
     address represented by the expression is removed.

<a name="R"><h3>SIM11  ON-LINE  HELP :   R  command</h3></a>
<pre>

SYNOPSIS
                R

DESCRIPTION
     Restart the machine.

     Main memory and registers are all re-assigned their initial values.
     However, the address view and list of breakpoints is left unchanged.


</pre>
<a href="#top">Back to top</a>
<a name="c"><h3>SIM11  ON-LINE  HELP :   c  command</h3></a>
<pre>

SYNOPSIS
                c

DESCRIPTION
     Continue execution with the instruction which is  pointed  to  by  the
     contents  of  the PC (r7).  Since the PC's initial contents are set by
     the value of the label  "main"  at the Assembler source program,   the
     first  time this command is invoked (and the PC has not been changed -
     see below) it starts execution at the address  specified  at  assembly
     time. (If  "main" was not defined at assembly time the default entry
     point is octal 2000, also the entry point may be set explicitly using
     the appropriate option of the ld11 program).

     Execution is stopped whenever a "halt" instruction, a "breakpoint"  or
     an  error  are encountered.  Control is always passed back to the user
     by giving the prompt sign ("@") and waiting for new user commands.

     The user can force the simulator to stop execution by pressing the
     "interrupt" key, which is on UNIX intr-key (default "^C"), however ...
     When the GUI is used, the "Stop" button serves that purpose.

<a name="s"><h3>SIM11  ON-LINE  HELP :   s  command</h3></a>
<pre>

SYNOPSIS
                s

DESCRIPTION
     Execute a single instruction and then stop displaying the current con-
     tents  of  all registers.  The instruction executed is that pointed at
     by the PC.  In other words, execute a "single step".

<a name="e"><h3>SIM11  ON-LINE  HELP :   e  command</h3></a>
<pre>

SYNOPSIS
                e  [ start_addr  [ , end_addr ] ]

DESCRIPTION
     Display the contents of  memory  ("examine").   If  no  arguments  are
     specified,  then all the  memory is displayed.   The argument may be a
     single expression, in which case that memory location is displayed, or
     a pair of  expressions separated by a comma,  in which case all memory
     between (and including) the two specified addresses is displayed.  The
     space after the "e" may be omitted.

     If only one memory word is examined,  its contents  are display in the
     following representations:

        one octal word
        one signed decimal word
        one unsigned decimal word
        one hexadecimal word
        two octal bytes
        two ascii characters

    Otherwise, only octal words are displayed.

                a index
                a index=value1
                a index=value1,
                a index=value1,value2

DESCRIPTION
     In full screen mode, the Memory window contains 16 memory peep  lines.
     Each line has a pointer, and can be in one of the following 3 modes:

       empty    - not used.
       single   - displays single memory location in variuos formats.
       multiple - displays for consecutive memory locations in octal.

     Empty lines are black.

     Single lines have the following format:
       [address]: octal decimal low-byte high-byte low-char high-char.

     Multiple lines have the following format:
       address  M[address]  M[adderss+2]  M[address+4]  M[address+6]

     With no arguments this command prints the index,  pointer and  mode of
     each line.

     With index only, the command empties the specified line.

     With one value and no following comma,   the command loads the pointer 
     of the specified line (by "index") with "value1",   and sets this line
     mode to "single".

     With one value and a following comma, the command loads the pointer of
     the specified line (by "index") with "value1", and sets this line mode
     to "multiple".

     With two values separated by a comma, the command loads the pointer of
     the specified line (by "index") with "value1", and sets this line mode
     to "multiple".  It then continues loading consecutive lines  (wrapping
     from 15 to 0) with advancing pointers,  until "value2" is reached,  or 
     all 16 lines are newly loaded.

     "index" must be between 0 and 17 (15.). "value" must be a legal memory
     address (between 0 and 077776).

<a name="IN"><h3>SIM11  ON-LINE  HELP :   &lt;  command</h3></a>
<pre>

SYNOPSIS
                &lt;  [ filename ]

DESCRIPTION
     This command allows the user to re-open the standard input file (stdin),
     or redirect stdin to another file.  Stdin is the source for the
     Terminal Keyboard of the simulated machine.

     Without an argument, the command will redirect stdin to the terminal,
     or to the terminal window in full_screen/window mode.

     With one agrument the command will redirect stdin to the specified file.

     If the specified file name is @, the current stdin file will be re-opened.
     If stdin was not redirected before using the &lt; command, the simulator has
     no idea of the current stdin file name, hence the command fails.

DESCRIPTION
     This command allows the user to re-open the standard output file (stdout),
     or redirect stdout to another file.  Stdout is the target for the
     Terminal Printer of the simulated machine.

     Without an argument, the command will redirect stdout to the terminal,
     or to the terminal window in full_screen/window mode.

     With one agrument the command will redirect stdout to the specified file.

     If the specified file name is @, the current stdout file will be re-opened.
     If stdout was not redirected before using the &gt; command, the simulator has
     no idea of the current stdout file name, hence the command fails.

DESCRIPTION
     This command allows you to control the logging of the simulator session.
     With no arguments it just print the logging status.
     With one argument '-' it terns the logging off.
     With one argument '+' it turns the logging on to the default file.
     With  '+' and a filename, it turns the logging on to that file.
     There is no need to turn the logging off, before changing to a new file.
     The simulator is activated with logging off unless the argument '-r'

<a name="sl"><h3>SIM11  ON-LINE  HELP :   /  command</h3></a>
<pre>

SYNOPSIS
                / addr

DESCRIPTION
     The  "/"  is used  to "open"  a memory location,  i.e.  examining  its
     contents,  and being able  to modify it and/or use it as  addresses to
     further memory locations.  The syntax  requires  that  an   expression
     follows   the "/", representing the memory location to be opened.
     Memory locations are always opened in word size,  an odd address opens
     the word containing the byte being addressed.

     For example "/100" followed by a CR (carriage return)  opens  location
     100  (octal).  The location opened can now be modified by entering any
     octal number. 

     Entering a CR after a location has been opened, without  preceding  it
     by  any  other symbol (see below) or number,  results in that location
     being "closed" and a prompt for a new command printed.

     SUB-COMMANDS (when there is an open location):

        .       change location forward
        ^       change location backwards
        @       change location indirect
        _       change location relative to the PC.

                $ reg

DESCRIPTION
     This command  is similar to the  "/" command,  but instead of opening
     a memory location, it opens a register.
     When a register is open, the "_" command  is illegal.

<pre>

SYNOPSIS
                ^

DESCRIPTION
     Once a location has been opened, the "^"  serves  to  move  backwards,
     i.e.  close  the  present  location  and open the preceding one.  When
     applied to open registers, it results in moving from register  "n"  to
     register  "n-1",  where  r7 follows after r0.  Movement through memory
     locations is in units of words, i.e. from "m" to "m-2".

SYNOPSIS
                .

DESCRIPTION
     Once a location has been opened, the "."  serves  to  move  forward,
     i.e.  close  the  present  location  and open the following one.  When
     applied to open registers, it results in moving from register  "n"  to
     register  "n+1",  where  r0 follows after r7.  Movement through memory
     locations is in units of words, i.e. from "m" to "m+2".

<pre>

SYNOPSIS
                @

DESCRIPTION
     This symbol is used for "indirect addressing", i.e.  the  contents  of
     the open location are interpreted as a memory address and the location
     corresponding to that address is  opened  after  the  present  one  is
     closed.

<a name="us"><h3>SIM11  ON-LINE  HELP :   _  command</h3></a>
<pre>

SYNOPSIS
                _

DESCRIPTION
     This symbol is used to  interpret  PC-relative  addresses  within  the
     machine  code.  It uses the address of the currently open memory loca-
     tion plus two, as if it were the contents of the PC, and  adds  to  it
     the contents of the memory location as displacement.

     For example, if we had "000100/001000" being displayed, entering "_" and
     then CR would result in the opening of location 1102 (=(100+2)+1000).

<pre>

SYNOPSIS
                p

DESCRIPTION
     This is an alias for the general command "c".

<a name="g"><h3>SIM11  ON-LINE  HELP :   g  command</h3></a>
<pre>

SYNOPSIS
                g  [ addr ]

DESCRIPTION
     This command is similar to the general command "c" with the difference
     that  it accepts an argument which is loaded into the PC before start-
     ing  execution.   The  argument  precedes  the  command  and  must  be
     separated  from  it  by a space.  Also, the PS (status word) is zeroed
     before control is passed to the program.

     If no argument is specified, the PC is loaded with the program entry
     point (see "c" command).
